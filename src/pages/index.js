The code you provided is for the Home component, which renders the Sketchpad, DoodleDisplay, and ErrorDisplay components. However, it does not include any logic for handling user drawings and generating code for a website based on the drawing. To implement this functionality, you would need to add event handlers to the Sketchpad component and write code to generate the website code based on the user's drawing. Here's an example of how you could start implementing this functionality:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import Sketchpad from '../components/Sketchpad';
import DoodleDisplay from '../components/DoodleDisplay';
import ErrorDisplay from '../components/ErrorDisplay';
import { makeStyles } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

const useStyles = makeStyles((theme) => ({
  root: {
    display: 'flex',
    flexDirection: 'column',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    height: '100vh',
    backgroundColor: theme.palette.background.default,
  },
}));

export default function Home() {
  const classes = useStyles();
  const [isDrawingFinished, setIsDrawingFinished] = useState(false);

  const handleFinishDrawing = () => {
    setIsDrawingFinished(true);
  };

  const generateWebsiteCode = () => {
    // Logic to generate website code based on user's drawing goes here
    // Return the generated code as a string
    return 'Generated website code';
  };

  return (
    <div className={classes.root}>
      <Sketchpad onFinishDrawing={handleFinishDrawing} />
      <DoodleDisplay />
      <ErrorDisplay />
      {isDrawingFinished && <div>{generateWebsiteCode()}</div>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the updated code, a state variable `isDrawingFinished` is introduced to keep track of whether the user has finished drawing. When the user finishes drawing (e.g., by clicking a "Finish" button in the Sketchpad component), the `handleFinishDrawing` function is called, which sets `isDrawingFinished` to `true`.

Inside the `generateWebsiteCode` function, you would implement the logic to generate the website code based on the user's drawing. This could involve parsing the drawing data and translating it into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

Finally, in the return statement, the generated website code is displayed only if `isDrawingFinished` is `true`.
